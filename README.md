# vcpkg ðŸ’• CMake integration
**Buckle up and get lift:**
* add a copy of `vcpkg.cmake` to your project, or include as git-*submodule*
* add `include(vcpkg.cmake)` before your call to `project(...)` [in your top-level `CMakeListst.txt`]
* have a **`vcpkg.json` manifest** in your project?
  * **YES:** ***DONE!* ðŸš€**
  * **NO:** add packages by calling `vcpkg_add_package(<pkg_name>)`
* ***DONE!* ðŸš€**

```cmake
# EXAMPLE

set(VCPKG_VERSION edge) # optional
include(vcpkg.cmake)

project(awesome-project)

# without 'vcpkg.json'-manifest
vcpkg_add_package(fmt)

...
```

**What does it do?**
* fetch *vcpkg* & build if required
* provide *"numeric"* or semantic versioning of *vcpkg* itself
* enable the *vcpkg*-*CMake* toolchain
* install all requested packages
* mask *musl-libc* from vcpkg as `x64-linux`/`x86-linux` and auto configure system binary usage âš¡
  
  
## using `vcpkg.json`-manifests
When a `vcpkg.json` manifest file is present, all packages from this manifest will be installed. Per default, `manifests` and `versions` features are enabled. Using `versions` currently requires a newer *vcpkg* version than tagged. Be sure to use version `edge` as per the examples.
  

## *vcpkg* versions
To set the desired *vcpkg* version use:
```cmake
set(VCPKG_VERSION <version>)
include(vcpkg.cmake)
```

Valid values for `<version>` are:
* `latest`: checks out latest tagged *vcpkg* version/release
* `<empty>`: gets you `latest`
* `edge`: latest commit on *vcpkg* master branch
* `<commit-hash>/<tag>`: any tag or commit hash from the *vcpkg*-repo may be used
  
  
## setting target/host architecture
To manually configure/override target or host architecture, override these before your call to `include(vcpkg.cmake)`. If any of the following variables is set, no additional configuration will be performed. *Remember to set environment variables on every run, as they are not cached!*
* `ENV{VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET}`
* `ENV{VCPKG_DEFAULT_HOST_TRIPLET}`
* `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`


## required system libs
Yes, bootstrapping *vcpkg* only goes that far, but: Setting up a build system and dev environment is not *vcpk*'s job.
*This is most relevant for use in build containers.* Most of the dependencies below are required to build C++ code in general and not *vcpkg* specific.

General requirements
* *C++* compiler toolchain
* *CMake*
* *Git*

### Ubuntu/Debian
```
apt install build-essential git cmake pkg-config curl zip unzip tar 
```

### alpine
Alpine uses `musl-libc` and can't use official binaries, as they are built against `glibc`. On alpine we detect `musl-libc` and need all system binaries available:
```
apk add build-base git cmake extra-cmake-modules abuild ninja curl
```
`musl-libc` will be masked as standard `x86-linux`/`x64-linux`, you may need to add extended compatibility (select right version):
```bash
# EXAMPLE
apk add libc6-compat
```


## âš¡ compatibility âš¡
**Unsure!**

Targeted platforms are "standard" Linux distros using *glibc* and Windows. Alpine, using *musl-libc*, is handled as an exception for its wide use in containerized applications. As long as the auto detected target-triplet of your platform is supported by *vcpkg* itself, no problems should arise.


## TODO
* testing *CMake* function individually
* checkout `baseline` when version is unset and using manifest
